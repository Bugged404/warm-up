# Warm-Up
This is the repository for our practice project with coding basic cards! Remember, the team breakdowns and steps are as follows.  

### Team Breakdown
**Group 1:** Parwiz, Alex, Ayaka, Gaurav  
**Group 2:** William, Teoman, Andrew  
**Group 3:** Rahul, Arturo, Hui, Ada  

Ayaka and Gaurav, you two have mentioned that you're not free to meet today, so see if you can complete the individual tasks and coordinate a time with your team tomorrow!

### Individual Steps
- clone the repo into your local workspace
- create a branch titled yourname-practice and go into it: `git checkout -b <yourname-practice>`
  - go to group#/individual-practice, create an html file yourname.html
  - starting with one suit (symbol) of cards (you can do multiple/ all of them if you want),try making designs for a card from that suite (number of your choice, you can do multiple if you want)
    - try different ways of visualizing it out! ASCII and unicode, HTML, etc
    - refer to existing code, the professor's demo from class for help
- commit and push your changes to your branch
- publish your branch: `git push origin <yourname-practice>`
- go to github.com and open a pull request to merge to main
- then merge your branch to main
  
### Group Steps
Find a time to meet up in person or call your mini-group to cowork, figuring out how to flip and shuffle the cards. Write code to do this; see the steps below as a a guide.  
1. Create a new branch named group#-card-interactions, checkout to that branch
2. Open necessary code files in your groups folder
3. Write code to visualize a card and perform the flip and shuffle in a single file
   1. try out the VSCode liveshare extension to collaborate together on a single file 
   2. Make sure to comment your code!
4. Commit and push changes to branch once you've gotten it working
5. Open a pull request to merge with the main branch
6. Merge your branch with the main branch

**Complete these steps by Saturday noon!**  
We'll meet up on Slack at **4-5 pm on Saturday** with whoever is free to discuss our approaches to task 1 of the exercise, and figure out expansions (parts 2 and 3).
